
Exercises three different scenarios

EAGER fetch of one to many YIELDS N+1 problem

Join fetch removes N+1 but introduces duplicates " Cartesian Product"

NamedEntityGraph ALSO  removes N+1 but introduces duplicates " Cartesian Product"
It does a LEFT OUTER Join so it would pick up parents with NO children
